- Never touch manage.py

- Inside folder dashboard_django we have :
	. wsgi.py file, it's a webserver that django will set up for us
	. urls.py file, it's an url routing system. A list of paths.
	. settings.py file, main configuration to django app.

- Start django server : python manage.py runserver (inside the project of course)

- Adding static files: 
	go to settings.py (into main folder)
	add STATICFILES_DIRS= [] os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
	add load static inside base.html
	link href={% static 'link/to/css/file'%}

- Adding image :
	go to settings.py
	add MEDIA_URL = '/images/'
	add load static inside the file where you put the image

- Migrate database :
	python manage.py migrate

- Creating a super user :
	python manage.py createsuperuser
	this will give us the oportunity to go over admin panel

- When creating a new model inside model.py, we need to use a new command line :
python manage.py makemigrations then python manage.py migrate then register it inside amin pannel by going inside admin.py adding the models like so from .models import Customer and then admin.site.register(Customer)
