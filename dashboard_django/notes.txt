- Never touch manage.py

- Inside folder dashboard_django we have :
	. wsgi.py file, it's a webserver that django will set up for us
	. urls.py file, it's an url routing system. A list of paths.
	. settings.py file, main configuration to django app.

- Start django server : python manage.py runserver (inside the project of course)
